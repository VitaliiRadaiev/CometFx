							<p class="gold _anim-items _fadeUp _anim-no-hide">Developing Your Trading Plan </p>
							<p class="_anim-items _fadeUp _anim-no-hide">
								Trading in foreign exchange can be risky, especially if you haven’t traded before. Most people who lose money trading in leveraged markets (such as the Forex market) do so because they haven’t undertaken the essential learning, have no trading discipline and no set trading plan.
							</p>
							<p class="_anim-items _fadeUp _anim-no-hide">
								Don't follow someone else's trading advice blindly. Just because someone may be doing well with their method, it doesn't mean it will work for you. We all have different market views, thought processes, risk tolerance levels, and market experience. Have your own personalized trading plan and update it as you learn from the market.

							<p class="_anim-items _fadeUp _anim-no-hide">
								Finding strategies that work and then preparing a trading plan takes some research and time to ensure it covers every essential aspect of keeping your risk capital safe and maximising your chances of success. Your trading plan should have the following as essential elements:

The reason so many potential traders fail early in their attempt is that they ignore this simple discipline that, if followed, will keep any trader from the disastrous losses that often spell the end of their trading endeavors. Here are some of the guidelines successful traders follow:

											<p>
												Don’t risk more than <b>1 percent of your capital</b> on any one trade. This rule, along with correct position sizing will keep you from risking too much of your capital at once, and from showing a disproportionately large loss on any trade.
											</p>

											<p>
												Know how to <b>calculate your risk-reward ratio</b>, or the ratio of how much you are likely to gain to how much you have at risk. The reward, or possible gain is based on the target price for the currency, which is the level you expect the exchange rate to reach based on your technical analysis. The risk is the total amount at risk based on where you place your stop, also calculated by reference to chart signals and patterns. Unlike shares, where a minimum risk reward ratio would be 1:3 – a possible gain of $3 for every $1 risked – the minimum acceptable ration in the Forex market is 1:1.

											<p>
												Learn about <b>stop losses</b> and how to use them. A stop-loss order (known as a stop) is an order to exit your position at a particular price as a means of limiting losses or helping to protect profits already made on positions that are still open. Determine the price level of your stop-loss by reference to the specific currency pair you are trading and its past behavior, as indicated by charting signals, rather than by simply placing it to keep losses to a known dollar amount. Pay particular attention to support and resistance, trend lines, and recent volatility when placing stops.

												Determine your position size based on how much you will lose if the stop is triggered at the indicated level, and the 1 per cent rule. You should know in advance <b>how much the likely maximum loss will be on the trade.</b>
