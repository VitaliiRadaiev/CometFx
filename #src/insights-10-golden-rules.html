Needless to say, Forex has become one of the most sought after and talked about investment opportunities. As in any industry, Forex has its own nature and golden rules. Learn Forex, the keys to success, and make your decisions wisely.

										There are many beginners who make trades in any direction. While there is a possibility for making profits both on the upside and downside, trading in the direction of the trend will give you the best trades and chances for success.

										Make a demo account and use it to learn and understand Forex trading. While using a demo account you will be able to test your trading strategies and mentally prepare yourself for a real trade. However, keep in mind, that you should be realistic and treat your demo funds as real money; otherwise, there is no way you can learn from demo trades.

										While there are a lot of companies who are earning money by selling software which aims to predict future trends, the reality is that if this software really worked, these companies would not be giving the secret away.

										Trading is a stressful work, and there will be a lot of setbacks on your way to the peak. Emotional trading may force you to open a trade too early and eventually lead to a loss due to a wrong entry. Control your emotions by staying cool and calm, and focus on your long-term goals

										Just because the Forex market is online twenty-four hours a day does not mean that you have to trade all that time. If you are doubtful, do not trade at all, but instead analyze the market and use the knowledge you get in the future to make more profitable trades.

										Because trading is always full of emotions, you must have a trading strategy, which includes a set of rules which you stick to, thus protecting you from yourself.

										Leverage, Forex trading has large potential rewards, but also large potential risk. As a novice, don’t risk more than 1–2% of your margin account on any given trade. Over the long run, this will give you a chance to make a profit while reducing the probability of taking a loss.

									<li>
										<div class="rulls__icon">
