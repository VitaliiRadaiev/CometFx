							<h2>Commodities - Oils</h2>
							<div class="block-text-img">
								<div class="block-text-img__text">
									<p>	
										Commodities are the lifeblood of our global economy and commodity trading is one of the world’s oldest trading forms, which existed before currency, bonds and stocks.
									</p>
									<p>	
										Commonly tradable commodities are categorized into four groups – energy (cruide oil and WTI), metals (gold, silver and copper), agricultural (coffee, wheat, sugar and cocoa) and finally livestock and meat (cattle).
									</p>
									<p>	
										Commodity trading is ideal for those who prefer to analyse supply and demand across the World, and how these affect commodities prices, in response to economic and political events. 
									</p>
									<p>	
										Trading oils requires no physical purchase of the commodity. Instead, you simply trade on the real-time price movements of the asset, meaning you have potential to profit whether the market is going up or down.

								A commodity is any physical good that can be bought or sold on the commodities market. Commodities work in a similar way to other financial markets. The exchange value of commodities is often affected by changes in supply and demand of the goods being traded. Commodities can be traded in the physical market or as a derivative.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first step of trading commodities is to decide what you want to trade. It is important to consider the properties of commodities, and what external factors may affect the commodity’s price. Commodities are often traded as financial derivatives. You buy if you think the price of the commodity will rise, and you sell if you think the price of the commodity will fall.
							</p>
							<p>
								Commodities are the basic building blocks of the global economy. They are natural resources traded on dedicated stock exchanges around the world. 
							</p>
							<p>
								There are two types of commodity – soft and hard. Soft commodities are typically agricultural like wheat or sugar, whereas hard commodities are metals or energies like silver and gas.
							</p>
							<p>
								The production and consumption of commodities depends on many factors, including:
